## Organize your desktop with Nodindow

If you have many applications open and want an efficient way to organize your desktop, Nodindow is the perfect solution for you! It was developed to help keep your work environment cleaner and more organized.

+ What Nodindow can do for you:
    - Organize your windows: If you have several applications open and easily get lost between them, Nodindow can help you organize your windows in a practical and quick way.
    - Quick window switching: If your work requires agility to switch between different tasks and windows, Nodindow allows you to do this in a simplified way, with just one click.
    - Better productivity: With a more organized desktop, you can focus on what really matters, without wasting time trying to locate windows or applications.

Whether you want to organize your windows, improve navigation or simply gain more space on your screen, Nodindow is the tool you need to work more efficiently.

## How to use

Nodindow must be launched with all applications closed. Only after it is opened will the user be able to start the
programs they want to use. Nodindow will only be able to manage and manipulate windows that were opened after its
startup. Any window that was already open before Nodindow was launched will not be recognized or controlled by the
system, unless the user moves the specific application from the ignore forms list to the working sphere.

The space node handles all windows within it without distinguishing between monitors. The spacePerScreen node organizes
the windows by separating them by monitor, allowing the space of each monitor to be manipulated individually by the
user. The user can control a specific monitor by moving the mouse cursor to the desired monitor and then move forward
or backward in space using the hotkeys (Ctrl + Up and Ctrl + Down), which only affect the monitor where the mouse
cursor is located.

To switch between different spaces or spacePerScreen, the user can use the hotkeys (Ctrl + Right and Ctrl + Left). To
hide or show an application, the default hotkey is Ctrl + Home.

The names of the monitors can be modified in the Settings/Monitors section. The changes will be applied globally to
new nodes.

### Technologies Used

+ Google.Cloud.Translation: Google Cloud library for text translation. Used to provide translation functionality in the project, allowing Nodindow to be accessible in multiple languages.

+ LiteBD: database-level library. Used to manage data within Nodindow, it provides fast and simple storage for the application without the need for a complex database system.

+ Newtonsoft.Json: One of the most popular libraries for JSON manipulation in .NET. Used to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of JSON objects, essential for data communication within the application.

### Environment variables
The translationTools project is used to translate Nodindow texts. It uses the Google.Cloud.Translation.V2 library to perform automatic translations.
#### Google Cloud API Configuration
To use translationTools and generate automatic translations, you must configure the Google Cloud API key in the Windows environment variables. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a project in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Enable the Google Cloud Translation API.
3. Generate the API key in the credentials panel.
4. Add the API key as an environment variable in Windows:
5. Variable name: GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY
6. Variable value: "sua_api_key_aqui"
+ How to configure the environment variable in Windows:
    1. Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
    2. Select "Edit system environment variables".
    3. In the advanced field, click on Environment Variables.
    4. In the "System Variables" section, click "New...".
    5. In the Variable name field, enter GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY.
    6. In the Variable value field, enter the API key that you generated in Google Cloud.
    7. Click OK to save.

After that, translationTools will be configured to use the Google Cloud API key for automatic translations.
